# Visitor-Guidance-and-Tracking-System

# Objectives

• To maintain visitor guidance tracking system for big premises, industries, 
hospital etc.

• To overcome the difficulties of reaching destination in larger premises.

• To keep record of no. of visitors, instead of writing the data or record of an 
individual in a book hence it reduces the “LABOUR WORK”.

• To maintain the security of the organisation by tracking the person’s exact 
location on the premise map and keeping the record of each visitor
